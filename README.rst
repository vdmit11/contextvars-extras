contextvars-extras
==================

``contextvars-extras`` is a set of extensions for the Python's `contextvars`_ module.

In case you are not familiar with the `contextvars`_ module, its `ContextVar`_ objects
work like Thread-Local storage, but better: they are both thread-safe and async task-safe,
and they can be copied (all existing vars copied in O(1) time), and then you can run
a function in the copied and isolated context.

.. _ContextVar: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.ContextVar

The `contextvars`_ is a powerful module, but its API seems too low-level.

So this ``contextvars_extras`` package provides some higher-level additions on top of the
standard API, like, for example, organizing `ContextVar`_ objects into registry classes,
with nice ``@property``-like access:

.. code:: python

    from contextvars_extras import ContextVarsRegistry

    class CurrentVars(ContextVarsRegistry):
        locale: str = 'en'
        timezone: str = 'UTC'

    current = CurrentVars()

    # calls ContextVar.get() under the hood
    current.timezone  # => 'UTC'

    # calls ContextVar.set() under the hood
    current.timezone = 'GMT'

    # ContextVar() objects can be reached as class members
    CurrentVars.timezone.get()  # => 'GMT'

That makes your code more readable (no more noisy ``.get()`` calls),
and it is naturally firendly to `typing`_, so static code analysis features
(like type checkers and auto-completion in your IDE) work nicely.
